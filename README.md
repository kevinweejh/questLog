## Project Overview

### Purpose

QuestLog isn't just a to-do list; it's an adventure-themed productivity app that turns your daily tasks into exciting quests. Designed for those seeking motivation and fun in their daily routines, QuestLog combines the practicality of a to-do list with the engaging elements of a role-playing game.

Check out the live version here: [QuestLog Demo](https://kevinweejh.github.io/questlog/).

### Key Features

- [x] Quest-Based Tasks: Each task you add as part of a quest is assigned with a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). 

- [ ] Character Progression (WIP): Create a character when you start using the app. Completing tasks levels up your character, unlocking new abilities and rewards.

- [ ] Reward System (WIP): Earn in-app currency, "Gold," by completing tasks. Use Gold to customize your character and unlock special abilities.

## Technical Details

### Local Storage
QuestLog stores your data using the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring it remains available even after closing the tab or window. That said, data persistence is not guaranteed in 'private browsing' mode or if your browser is set to clear data automatically. It is worth noting that the data stored in `localStorage` is specific to the domain of QuestLog, so it can't be accessed by other websites, enhancing security and privacy.

### Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
QuestLog uses `uuid` for task and quest IDs. This ensures that all tasks and quests have a unique identifier. This is beneficial as it allows each task and quest to be easily referenced by modules. 

Additional benefits not yet explored in this current iteration of QuestLog include: 
1. **Synchronization**: UUIDs eliminate the risk of duplication, which is crucial when quests/tasks need to be shared across multiple devices or platforms.
2. **Privacy**: UUIDs can be used to unique session or user IDs. As UUIDs are generated independently of the user, they do not reveal any potentially private information about the user itself. 

### Image Compression
QuestLog integrates the use of `image-minimizer-webpack-plugin`, specifically employing the `imagemin-mozjpeg` JPEG encoder, within the Webpack configuration. This ensures that all images are automatically optimized as part of the build process. This step is crucial for improving the performance of QuestLog by reducing the size of image assets without compromising on quality.
